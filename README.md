# Chrome dino Hack

I bet everyone knows the famous **dino game** that appears when internet is down on chrome. During DevFest 2020 we were challenged to "hack" it through the console.

## Features

- No Game Over: collisions don't stop you from running, they just slow you down (and that's a feature)

- Starts in dark mode (night time)

- hitting left and right arrow keys adjusts your speed

- archaic mode: night time and day time alternate in a "random" way

## Usage

1. go [here](chrome://dino/) on chrome

2. open the console or do ctrl + alt + i

3. copy the contents of main.js into the console

4. and Enjoy the chaos
